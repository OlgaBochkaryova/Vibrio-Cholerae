'the small chromosome may have originally been a megaplasmid that was captured by an ancestral Vibrio species. The V. cholerae genomic sequence provides a starting point for understanding how a free-living, environmental organism emerged to become a significant human bacterial pathogen.' 
'Several lines of evidence suggest that chromosome 2 was originally a megaplasmid captured by an ancestral Vibrio species.'
'It is also of interest that many of the repair genes are on chromosome 2 (alkA, ada1, ada2, phr3, mutK, sbcCD, dcm, mutT3), indicating that this chromosome is probably required for full DNA repair capability.'

'Nevertheless, it is apparent that phages and PAI use conserved genes as integration sites. These conserved genes might confer safety to the mobile genetic element that they can integrate in any genome of members of a given population. This need could be, in an evolutionary biology point of view, important to maintain pathogenicity factors in a bacterial population (329).'
